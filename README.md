## ampersand-es6-example

Sample setup with Ampersand, Handlebars, Gulp, Babel and Webpack over ES6, transpiled to ES5 (source maps included).

All the code and config files from Gulp and Webpack are ES6.

The is a **preload** bundle (to be loaded during page load time) and also a separate bundle (to be lazy loaded after the user presses a button).

The lazy-loadable bundles are automatically generated by webpack and the code is just requiring things internally using ES6/CommonJS, making it possible to avoid AMD/RequireJS for asynchronous loading.

Running ```gulp``` will:

1. Transpile ES6 code with Babel
2. Compile Handlebars templates
3. Package bundles with Webpack (dedupe + uglify)

See it live: run ```gulp server``` and open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Verify you have downloaded just the preload JS bundle file. Now hit the buttons, it will download the additional bundle files, related with the button you've just hit.
